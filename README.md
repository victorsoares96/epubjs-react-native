# epubjs-react-native

A digital book reader in .opf .epub format for react native using epub.js library inside a webview.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @epubjs-react-native/core
```

```sh
yarn add @epubjs-react-native/core
```

follow these steps below based on the type of project you want to apply this library:

#### Bare Installation

```sh
npm install @epubjs-react-native/file-system react-native-fs react-native-webview react-native-gesture-handler
```

```sh
yarn add @epubjs-react-native/file-system react-native-fs react-native-webview react-native-gesture-handler
```

#### Expo Installation

```sh
npx expo install @epubjs-react-native/expo-file-system react-native-fs react-native-webview react-native-gesture-handler
```

#### If you develop for iOS use this command for install CocoaPods deps (if you use an expo managed project you don't need this)

In your ios project folder run:

```sh
npx pod-install
```

For bare react-native projects, add the following permissions to `Info.plist`:

```sh
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
```

## Usage

Wrap your root component in ReaderProvider. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to AppRegistry.registerComponent. This will usually be in the index.js file. If you have an Expo project, you can do this inside the exported component in the App.js file.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { ReaderProvider } from '@epubjs-react-native/core';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';
import App from './src/App';

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <ReaderProvider>
      <App />
    </ReaderProvider>
  );
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => Main);
```

The `<ReaderProvider>` component provides `<Reader>` manipulation methods for all components of the framework.
**Without this the `useReader` hook will not work.**

After the above step you can initialize the reader as follows:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';
import { Reader, useReader } from '@epubjs-react-native/core';
// import { useFileSystem } from '@epubjs-react-native/file-system'; // for Bare React Native project
// import { useFileSystem } from '@epubjs-react-native/expo-file-system'; // for Expo project

export default function App() {
  const { goToLocation } = useReader();
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Reader
        src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moby-dick/OPS/package.opf"
        fileSystem={useFileSystem}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```
